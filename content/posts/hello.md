- Sometime in 2010, I picked up Android. I've had more than 10 years of Java experience at that point, so I thought it wasn't going to be a big deal. I was wrong â€” writing programs for Android was very different from writing programs for the web and desktop
- 2013, I held some seminars and workshops on the subject
- 2015, I started writing Minimum Android Programming on LeanPub. A couple of folks bought it, even if it wasn't finished yet
- Valentines day of 2017, I got an email from Apress, they wanted me to revise "Learn Android Studio"
- July 2017, Finalizing the instructional design
- August 2017, signed the contract for 2 books
- 3rd quarter 2017, I began writing Learn Android Studio 3 (Java ed)
- Nov 2017, I'm not nearly half-finished. But I have to deal with the "technical review" part. This is where another technologist reviews what you wrote. They're trying to make sure you're not saying anything grossly wrong in the manuscript (on the technical side)
- First week of Dec 2017, I was down with some nasty viral infection. I never realized how difficult it was to write on queue and with deadlines. When I was publishing on LeanPub, I kept the schedule. That's not the case when you have a contract. It's all good, but I think my body is taking the toll from all those writing. I never knew it was going to be this stressful. I still managed to turn in the final chapter of the book. I was very tired, but my work isn't done yet
- Just before Christmas of 2017, I was still doing the final edits after "Technical Review". I ran out of time, that's why Apress got some help. The last final edits of the last 4 chapters was done by another author  
- January 2018. Started writing the Kotlin edition. That brings us to speed now. What happens next, will be part of the posts
