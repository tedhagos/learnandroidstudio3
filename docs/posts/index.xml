      <description>Sometime in 2010, I picked up Android. I&amp;rsquo;ve had more than 10 years of Java experience at that point, so I thought it wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be a big deal. I was wrong â€” writing programs for Android was very different from writing programs for the web and desktop 2013, I held some seminars and workshops on the subject 2015, I started writing Minimum Android Programming on LeanPub. A couple of folks bought it, even if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t finished yet Valentines day of 2017, I got an email from Apress, they wanted me to revise &amp;ldquo;Learn Android Studio&amp;rdquo; July 2017, Finalizing the instructional design August 2017, signed the contract for 2 books 3rd quarter 2017, I began writing Learn Android Studio 3 (Java ed) Nov 2017, I&amp;rsquo;m not nearly half-finished.</description>
