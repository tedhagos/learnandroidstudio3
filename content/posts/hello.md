Sometime ago, I wrote a small book about Android Programming. I published it in LeanPub, a couple of folks bought. That was great. But today, on Valentine's day. Got a message from a LeanPub reader, it was from Apress, I was asked to explore the possibility of revising one of their titles , "Learn Android Studio IDE".
